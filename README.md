#The Roa Toolkit

This is the Roa Toolkit repo, all useful commands, tricks, shorcuts and little hints that you discover along the way should go in here.

This repo should also be a base for building on a solid understanding of typical git workflow.

## Step one: Branching
When you find a shortcut and want to share it, create a new branch, add it to the 'toolkit' section where you think suites best and push it up to github.

## Step two: Pull Requests
Pull requests are fundamental to creating great code efficiently in a team. It's important to ensure that every commit to a repo contains good, valid, working and DRY code. Getting all code peer reviewed is one of the easieist ways to uphold this. Once you have pushed up your branch, open a new pull request (go to 'pull requests' and click new - creating one comparing your branch to master). Once you have done this, tag someone else in the co-hort to review your work (under the 'assignee' section on the right).

## Step three: reviewing
If you have been assigned to a pull request, you should review it. Open it up, look at the files changed. If you find anything amiss write a comment and notify the person who opened the pull request, the person who owns the pullr equest should then review and respond to your comments, either updating their branch or justifying their approach in a reply comment.

## Step four: Merge!
If everyone is happy with the work, merge it in! (Don't forget to delete the branch afterwards, nothing more annoying than excess dead branches on a flourishing repo)

###Things to bear in mind

- Excellent commit messages:
  These needs to be atomic, below 80 charaters
- Not to many commits:
  each commit needs to contain a feature within itself, even if this means commiting several files.
- Comments on pull requests must be construcive, and useful (Never forget the ASK!)
- You cannot merge in your own branch, it *has* to be peer reviewed
- You are responsible for getting your branch merged in, so chase people up on it if they have yet to review your work
