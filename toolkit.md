You can add a custom sublime shortcut that inserts the text `console.log()`.  I made this because it is the command I use most often.  Open Sublime, click Sublime Text from the menu, preferences, key bindings - user.
My file looks like this:
`[{"keys": ["alt+z"], "command": "insert_snippet", "args": {"contents": "console.log()"}},]`
This means I can press alt-z in sublime, and `console.log()` appears before my cursor.


Move whole lines up or down the page in sublime without copying or pasting anything:
<br>
'ctrl +cmd + up arrow or down arrow'
<br>
Copy whole lines of code:
<br>
'cmd + shft + d'
